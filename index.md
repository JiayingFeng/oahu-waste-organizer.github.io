## About
Currently, trash audits across UH campuses have a very primitive way of storing and calculating data. It consists of a single piece of paper and one very hard working individual. One representative is in search of a more streamlined solution of storing the data.

Our solution to this problem is to create a user-friendly web application that utilizes intuitive design to streamline data input and visualization. In other words, make trash data more pretty!

Our final project consists of members Alton Lee, Emily Pang, and Jake Weber. Our project is inspired by our HACC team consisting of Leighton Villanueva, Alton Lee, Emily Pang, Jake Weber, Nicholas Lum, Ethan Chow, Jordan Ooka, Cristian Aspacio, and Ty Uehara.

## Development History

### Milestone 1 Mockup Development

A page idea we could use is a form that simplifies trash input that any logged in user can add. Bags and Categories can be added as needed. Our home page is accessible to the general public and contains information and data of previous years of trash auditing. The home page also links to a heat map of the different campuses and how much trash each building produces on each campus.

The input form will imitate the paper excel sheet used at the UH trash audits.
